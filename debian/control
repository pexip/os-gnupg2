Description: GNU privacy guard - signature verification tool
 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 .
 gpgv is actually a stripped-down version of gpg which is only able
 to check signatures. It is somewhat smaller than the fully-blown gpg
 and uses a different (and simpler) way to check that the public keys
 used to make the signature are valid. There are no configuration
 files and only a few options are implemented.

Description: GNU privacy guard - network certificate management service
 dirmngr is a server for managing and downloading OpenPGP and X.509
 certificates, as well as updates and status signals related to those
 certificates.  For OpenPGP, this means pulling from the public
 HKP/HKPS keyservers, or from LDAP servers.  For X.509 this includes
 Certificate Revocation Lists (CRLs) and Online Certificate Status
 Protocol updates (OCSP).  It is capable of using tor for network
 access.
 .
 dirmngr is used for network access by gpg, gpgsm, and dirmngr-client,
 among other tools.

 GnuPG is GNU's tool for secure communication and data storage.
 It can be used to encrypt data and to create digital signatures.
 It includes an advanced key management facility and is compliant
 with the proposed OpenPGP Internet standard as described in RFC 4880.
 .
 This is GnuPG's signature verification tool, gpgv, built statically
 so that it can be directly used on any platform that is running on
 the Linux kernel.  Android and ChromeOS are two well known examples,
 but there are many other platforms that this will work for, like
 embedded Linux OSes.  This gpgv in combination with debootstrap and
 the Debian archive keyring allows the secure creation of chroot
 installs on these platforms by using the full Debian signature
 verification that is present in all official Debian mirrors.
